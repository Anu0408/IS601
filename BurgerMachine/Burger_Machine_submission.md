<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Calculate cost is a class-related method that is defined in this code. This<br>method's goal is to figure out how much a burger that is in<br>the process of being made and is represented by a list of ingredients<br>(self.inprogress burger) will cost. The method initializes a variable cost to 0, and<br>then employs a for loop to repeatedly iterate through each element of the<br>ongoing burger. Next, by gaining access to each component's cost attribute, it adds<br>the cost of each component to the cost variable. The function uses the<br>format() method to format the cost variable as a string with a dollar<br>sign and two decimal places after the loop is finished. The total cost<br>of the burger is then displayed in a message printed to the console<br>using an f-string. The unformatted cost value is returned at the end. Essentially,<br>this code provides a way to figure out how much a burger will<br>cost in total based on the extras that have been added to it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>Also,<br>Python's built-in format() method is used to format the currency values. This technique<br>allows the formatting of a string with placeholders that can be filled with<br>specific values. In this instance, a string with the placeholder ":,.2f" for the<br>cost variable is passed to the format() method. According to this placeholder, the<br>cost variable must be represented as a floating-point number with two decimal places<br>and a comma to denote thousands. The formatted string that is produced is<br>then kept in the formatted cost variable and used to print the total<br>cost of the burger in a comprehensible manner to the console.</div></div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>1. Out_Of_Stock_Exception:&nbsp;</b>When a certain item or resource is either completely out<br>of stock or not available in adequate quantities, a program may raise the<br>out-of-stock exception. The code above specifies a class-level method named use for an<br>object whose quantity can be decreased each time it is used. This item<br>is assumed to be represented by the use method. The -= operator is<br>used to begin the method by deducting 1 from the quantity attribute of<br>the class instance on which it is called. This line subtracts one from<br>the item's quantity. The procedure then uses an if statement to see if<br>the new value of the quantity attribute is less than zero. The method<br>throws an OutOfStockException if the amount is less than zero since that indicates<br>that the item is out of stock. An optional exception called OutOfStockException could<br>be defined somewhere else in the program. This exception, which most likely descended<br>from the built-in Exception class, serves to display a more detailed error message<br>when an item is out of stock. Lastly, the method returns the updated<br>value of the quantity property if the quantity is higher than or equal<br>to zero. This is the amount of the item that is still available<br>after use.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>2. Needs_Cleaning_Exception:&nbsp;</b>A custom exception called NeedsCleaningException can be thrown in<br>a program when an object or resource has to be reset or cleaned<br>up before it can be used again. When the remaining uses attribute of<br>a class instance is less than or equal to zero and the pick<br>patty function is called on it in the provided code, a NeedsCleaningException is<br>thrown. This means that before the machine that dispensed the patties can be<br>used again, it must be cleaned or restarted. An exception is generated to<br>let the user or developer know that the resource or object is not<br>currently usable and needs to go through some further processing before it can<br>be utilized once more.&nbsp;The code indicates that the condition is exceptional and that<br>the caller should take steps to address it, such as cleaning the machine<br>or resetting it, before using the pick patty method again by generating a<br>NeedsCleaningException rather than merely providing an error message.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;">The above<br>code demonstrates how to handle a try-except block's NeedsCleaningException. The code enters the<br>except section and runs the code there if the NeedsCleaningException is thrown in<br>the try block. To alert the user that the computer requires cleaning in<br>this situation, the code outputs a message to the console. The program then<br>starts a while loop, which will run indefinitely until the user writes "clean."<br>The user is prompted to type "clean" within this loop in order to<br>begin the cleaning process. When the user types the word "clean," the code<br>executes the clean machine function on the class instance that it is now<br>running on. This approach supposedly carries out the tasks required to clean or<br>reset the device so that it can be utilized once more. The code<br>exits the while loop after calling the clean machine method, printing a message<br>to the console to notify the user that the machine has been cleaned.<br>The while loop is continued and the user is prompted to type "clean"<br>once again if the user does not type "clean." If the user does<br>not write "clean," the code prints a message to the console to alert<br>the user that the machine has not been cleaned. Until the user types<br>"clean" or the software is somehow stopped, this procedure will go on.</div><div style="text-align:<br>justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>3. Invalid_Choice_exception:&nbsp;</b>When a user or application tries to select or use<br>an invalid or unsupported option or choice, a custom exception known as InvalidChoiceException<br>may be raised in the program.&nbsp; When the pick patty function on an<br>instance of a class is called in the provided code and the user<br>selects an incorrect patty choice that does not exist in the system, InvalidChoiceException<br>is raised. This exception is caught and handled by the unless block that<br>deals with the InvalidChoiceException by reporting the proper error message to the console.<br>The stage or category where the incorrect choice was made is identified in<br>the notification. This information is useful for debugging since it makes it simpler<br>to identify the issue's source and locate the issue's cause. The ExceededRemainingChoicesException exception,<br>which is thrown when there are no more choices of a certain category<br>left in the machine, is also handled in this function together with the<br>InvalidChoiceException exception. These exceptions are handled similarly by printing the relevant message to<br>the console.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>4. Exceeded_remaining_choices_exception:</b>&nbsp;When the pick patty method on an<br>instance of a class is called and there are no more options in<br>the machine for the provided category, the ExceededRemainingChoicesException is raised in the example<br>code. The unless block handles this exception when it arises by printing the<br>proper error message to the console. The stage/category where the exceeded remaining choices<br>error occurred is identified in the notification. The code not only prints the<br>error notice but also determines what stage the burger-making process is in right<br>now. When there are no more patties available in the selecting patties stage,<br>the code switches to the toppings stage and sets the currently selecting instance<br>variable's value to STAGE. Toppings. If the procedure is in the choosing toppings<br>stage and there are no more toppings available, the code advances to the<br>payment stage by setting the currently selecting instance variable's value to STAGE.Pay. This<br>handling of the ExceededRemainingChoicesException enables the code to fluidly transition between phases of<br>the burger creation process and clearly indicate to the user what stage they<br>are in and where they should proceed next.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><b>5. Invalid_Payment_exception</b>:<br>When a user tries to purchase a burger with an invalid payment amount,<br>the InvalidPaymentException exception is raised in the provided code. This exception is caught<br>by the unless block when it occurs, and it is handled by printing<br>the proper error message to the console. The notification instructs the user to<br>enter the precise payment amount needed in this instance. The except block additionally<br>manages any additional exceptions with the catch-all error message "Something went wrong" as<br>a default. This is beneficial in the event that an unforeseen error occurs<br>that cannot be handled by any of the other except blocks. Last but<br>not least, the run() method is called once more to keep running whether<br>an exception is raised or not.</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p><b>Test Cases: </b>The test cases evaluate a burger ordering machine&#39;s functioning. The user<br>will be required to provide the machine with information about the type of<br>bread, patty, toppings, and payment. The Pytest framework is used to implement the<br>test cases.<div><br></div><div><b>Test Case 1:</b> The machine is configured with the user inputs for<br>a vegetarian turkey burger with no bun, mayo as a topping, and payment<br>of $2.25 in the first fixture, &quot;Test Case1 first order.&quot; The machine instance<br>is returned by this fixture. The second fixture, called &quot;Test Case1 second order,&quot;<br>starts with the previous fixture and adds more inputs for a turkey-vegetarian burger<br>with a white burger bun and cheese on top. The same machine instance,<br>but with the additional inputs, is returned by this fixture.&nbsp;The actual test case,<br>&quot;test 1,&quot; checks if the name of the bun object matches the name<br>of the first item in the &quot;inprogress burger&quot; list of the machine instance<br>to assert that the second order has the right sort of bun. The<br>test case fails and the assertion is false if the machine did not<br>choose the right bun.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Test Case 2:</b>&nbsp; The Test Case2 first-order fixture creates a<br>scenario in which the user pays $2 for each order of a turkey<br>burger that comes with no bun and no toppings. The test 2 function<br>simulates a person attempting to add an additional turkey patty to a hamburger<br>using the machine. The customer attempting to add an additional turkey patty should<br>receive an OutOfStockException since the machine only has 10 turkey patties available. The<br>test case tries to add the eleventh patty while catching the exception to<br>see if this behavior occurs. The test case succeeds if the exception is<br>caught, and fails otherwise with a message stating that the exception was not<br>raised.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Test Case 3:</b>&nbsp;Test Case3 first order is a fixture that builds a replica<br>of the burger ordering system and carries out a series of operations to<br>produce 5 orders, each containing a vegetable patty and two cheese toppings. When<br>a customer attempts to add an additional cheese topping to their purchase (test<br>3), the machine should raise an OutOfStockException as per the test case. Starting<br>with five orders that each contain one veggie patty and two cheese toppings,<br>the test uses the Test Case3 first order fixture. Next it tries to<br>upgrade the sixth order by adding an additional cheese topping, anticipating that the<br>system will throw an OutOfStockException. Testing is successful if the exception is raised.<br>The test is invalid if the exception is not thrown.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Test Case 4:</b>&nbsp; The<br>initial fixture Test Case4 first order builds a test case in which the<br>machine is reset, patties are added to the burger (veggie, turkey, and turkey),<br>no toppings are added, and the money is processed. It also verifies that<br>the patties were properly inserted to the burger. The secondary fixture Test Case4<br>second order expands on the preceding fixture by adding patties to the burger<br>(veggie, turkey, and turkey), again without toppings, and processing the payment. It also<br>verifies that the patties were properly inserted to the burger. The actual test<br>case test 4 verifies that the patties have been properly inserted to the<br>burgers by comparing the two results of the two fixtures. It returns Yes<br>if the test is successful and False if it fails.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Test Case 5:</b>&nbsp; To<br>simulate an order, the fixture creates the machine object and calls many methods.<br>The selected toppings are then checked to see if they are present in<br>the inprogress burger list to see if the order has been appropriately processed<br>by the machine. In the event that the toppings are processed appropriately, Test<br>Case5 result 1 is set to True. The second section, which expands on<br>the first fixture, defines a new fixture function called Test Case5 second order.<br>This fixture imitates a second order by calling the machine object&#39;s methods further.<br>Test Case5 result 2 is set to True if the toppings are properly<br>handled. The Test Case5 second order fixture is used in the third part&#39;s<br>test 5 test function definition. The assertion made by this function is that<br>Test Case5 result 1 and Test Case5 result 2 are both True, proving<br>that both orders were properly handled.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Test Case 6:</b>&nbsp;The test 6 test case determines<br>whether the amounts paid for the first three orders are identical and the<br>amount paid for the fourth order is different. In addition to ensuring that<br>Test Case6 result 1, Test Case6 result 2, and Test Case6 result 3<br>are all true, it verifies that all fixtures have been correctly handled. The<br>test case succeeds if all of these requirements are satisfied.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Test Case 7:</b>&nbsp;Test Case7<br>first order, the first fixture, configures an order with &quot;no bun,&quot; two &quot;Turkey&quot;<br>patties, and no toppings. It then makes a total payment of $2. In<br>the second fixture, Test Case7 second order, a &quot;wheat burger bun,&quot; a &quot;veggie&quot;<br>patty, a &quot;turkey&quot; patty, and a &quot;beef&quot; patty are added to the first<br>order. Then it adds &quot;cheese,&quot; &quot;mayo,&quot; and &quot;bbq&quot; toppings before paying $5 in<br>total. The second order is improved upon in the third fixture, Test Case7<br>third order, which substitutes a &quot;lettuce wrap&quot; for the bun and does away<br>with the &quot;beef&quot; patty. Then, it adds &quot;cheese,&quot; &quot;mustard,&quot; and &quot;bbq&quot; toppings before<br>paying $4.25 altogether. The test 7 function then determines whether the machine&#39;s total<br>sales after processing the third order are $11.25 and asserts that it is<br>True if they are or False if they are not.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Test Case 8:</b>&nbsp;The fixture<br>Test Case8 first order initializes the device, places a 1.5 USD order for<br>a veggie patty with cheese and ketchup toppings, and then returns the device<br>object. Test Case8 second order: A fixture that adds a second order with<br>a lettuce wrap, a veggie, a turkey patty, ketchup, cheese, and barbecue sauce,<br>utilizes the Test Case8 first order fixture as a parameter, pays for the<br>order with 4.25 USD, and then returns the machine object. Test Case8 second<br>order fixture is used in test 8, a test function that examines the<br>total number of hamburgers sold by the machine, passes the test if the<br>number is equal to 2, and fails if it is not.&nbsp;By counting the<br>total number of burgers sold, the test confirms that the device processes orders<br>accurately. If the device returns 2 as the total quantity of hamburgers sold,<br>the test case is successful.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, the results of these test cases confirm<br>that the machine object can successfully handle numerous orders with various sets of<br>toppings and that the chosen toppings are processed and added to the inprogress<br>burger list in a proper manner.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></p><br></td></tr>
